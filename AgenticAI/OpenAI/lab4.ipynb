       "In 2025, several AI agent frameworks have emerged, each offering unique capabilities for developing autonomous systems:\n",
       "\n",
       "- **Agent Lightning**: A flexible framework enabling reinforcement learning-based training of large language models for any AI agent. It decouples agent execution from training, allowing seamless integration with existing agents and supports complex interaction logic. ([arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03680?utm_source=openai))\n",
       "\n",
       "- **Polymorphic Combinatorial Framework (PCF)**: Utilizes large language models and mathematical frameworks to design adaptive AI agents capable of real-time parameter reconfiguration. It defines a multidimensional parameter space to capture agent behaviors, supporting scalable and ethical AI applications. ([arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01581?utm_source=openai))\n",
       "\n",
       "- **GoalfyMax**: A protocol-driven multi-agent system that introduces a standardized Agent-to-Agent communication layer, allowing independent agents to coordinate through asynchronous interactions. It incorporates a layered memory system for structured knowledge retention and continual learning. ([arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09497?utm_source=openai))\n",
       "\n",
       "- **Cognitive Kernel-Pro**: An open-source, multi-module agent framework designed to democratize the development and evaluation of advanced AI agents. It focuses on curating high-quality training data and enhancing agent robustness and performance. ([arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00414?utm_source=openai))\n",
       "\n",
       "- **Google Antigravity**: An AI-powered integrated development environment (IDE) that enables developers to delegate complex coding tasks to autonomous AI agents. It introduces an \"agent-first\" paradigm, shifting from traditional AI code assistance to a system where AI agents operate with greater autonomy. ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Antigravity?utm_source=openai))\n",
       "\n",
       "- **OpenAI Agents SDK**: A lightweight Python framework focusing on creating multi-agent workflows with comprehensive tracing and guardrails. It offers provider-agnostic compatibility with over 100 different large language models.

       "\n",
       "- **Manus**: An autonomous AI agent developed by Butterfly Effect Technology, designed to independently execute complex real-world tasks without continuous human supervision. It is one of the first fully autonomous AI agents capable of independent reasoning, dynamic planning, and autonomous decision-making. ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manus_%28AI_agent%29?utm_source=openai))\n",
       "\n",
